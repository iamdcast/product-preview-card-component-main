## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I used more CSS Grid. I had struggle create the border radius for the button. Ended up looking up other ways of creating radius on the button and figured it out.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
 .button {
      background-color: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
      color: white;
      -webkit-border-radius: 5px;
      -moz-border-radius: 5px;
      border-radius: 5px;
      margin: 0%;
      height: 50px;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      width: auto;
    }
```

### Continued development

I will be tackling more JS projects
